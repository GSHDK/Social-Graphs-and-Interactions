    "### Data\n",
    "Almost everyone have a strong relationship to movies, the intrigue, enlighten, make you cry and make you laugh. We wanted to know more about the structure of the largest productions of them all, and that is why the project evolves around the [tmdb 5000](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) dataset. This dataset contains data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films, but have the advantage that the data is already filtered and cleaned. We choose this dataset as is provides a good foundation of our analysis, but other data sources will also in the report to verify and support the findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Goal of the project\n",
    "The overall idea of this project is to investigate interesting properties of Hollywood acting environment and how it has developed over time? As the dataset contains a lot of information, these properties have split into two major areas of focus. \n",
    "* Movies as a Voice of the times and the Evolution of Hollywood itself\n",
    "* Hollywood as a closed community structue, with few Actors working alot together. Furthermore, that these communities also exsist outside the set of the movies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are of course many more interesting elements to look at, kaggle suggests looking at \"... the success of a movie before it is released?\", or \"Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula?\", but our goal is that after having read this notebook, one would have gotten an in depth understanding of **hollywood as a voice of the times** and **the closed community structure of it**\n",

    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The analysis is split into different section to improove readability. Sections assume elements from ealiere sections are already established**"
